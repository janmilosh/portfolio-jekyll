Welcome to my portfolio site! As with all of my projects, creating this site has been an adventure in learning a new technology. In this case, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I'm motivated by challenges, so in these pages you will see the result of my persuit of various challenges.

On my first introduction to AngularJS, I was hooked. I was then fortunate to find a position in a company that embraced that technology and gave me the opportunity to develop those skills. Both my personal Angular projects and collaborations with my co-workers are presented here.

You will notice some WordPress projects. My early Web consulting work consisted of developing custom WordPress sites for small business clients. I've also included a few of these projects.

In my current position, I work with primarily AngularJS and Python (Django).
