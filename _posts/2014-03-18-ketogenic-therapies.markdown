[![ketogenictherapies.com]({{ "/images/ketogenictherapies.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})](http://ketogenictherapies.com)

I built [ketogenictherapies.com](http://ketogenictherapies.com)Â in AngularJS. The client required a site that was upbeat, yet tasteful for the intended audience of terminal cancer patients. This static site made use of Angular's routing feature.
